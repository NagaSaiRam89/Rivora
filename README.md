## \#\# Key Features

  * **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login with both email/password and Google OAuth 2.0.
  * **High-Fidelity Local Recording**: Records video and audio directly on each participant's machine to avoid quality loss from network issues.
  * **Resilient Chunk-Based Uploads**: Recordings are split into small chunks and uploaded to the cloud in real-time, preventing data loss if a connection drops.
  * **Studio Management**: Create, schedule, and manage your recording studios.
  * **Guest Invitations**: Easily invite guests to your studio with a unique link sent via email.
  * **Real-Time Video Chat**: Built on top of the 100ms SDK for a stable and low-latency video communication experience during recordings.
  * **Automated Post-Production Pipeline**: A powerful, queue-based backend system that automatically:
    1.  Concatenates each participant's video chunks.
    2.  Merges the final host and guest videos into a professional side-by-side layout.
    3.  Cleans up raw files to manage storage.
  * **Email Notifications**: Receive an email notification as soon as your final, merged video is ready to be viewed and downloaded.

## \#\# Architecture Overview

Rivora is a full-stack monorepo application built with a modern, decoupled architecture.

  * **Frontend**: A responsive and interactive client-side application built with **React (Vite)** and deployed on **Vercel**.
  * **Backend API**: A robust **Node.js/Express** server that handles user authentication, session management, and API requests. Deployed on **Render**.
  * **Video Processing Pipeline**: The core of the application. It uses a **BullMQ** job queue backed by **Redis (Upstash)** to offload heavy video processing tasks. This ensures the API remains fast and responsive while the **FFmpeg**-powered worker handles video concatenation and merging in the background.

## \#\# Tech Stack

### Frontend

  * **Framework**: React (with Vite)
  * **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
  * **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
  * **Form Handling**: `react-hook-form` & `zod`
  * **Real-Time Video**: 100ms SDK
  * **Authentication**: `@react-oauth/google`

### Backend

  * **Runtime**: Node.js
  * **Framework**: Express.js
  * **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
  * **Background Jobs**: BullMQ
  * **Authentication**: JWT (in httpOnly cookies), bcrypt
  * **Media Processing**: FFmpeg, Cloudinary SDK

### Database & Infrastructure

  * **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
  * **Queue**: Redis (Upstash)
  * **Media Storage**: Cloudinary
  * **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend)

-----

## \#\# Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  * Node.js (v18 or later)
  * npm / yarn
  * A running MongoDB instance (local or Atlas)
  * A running Redis instance (local or Upstash)

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NagaSaiRam89/Rivora.git
    cd Rivora
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**

      * Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend`
      * Install dependencies: `npm install`
      * Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example`.
      * Fill in the required environment variables (see below).
      * Start the server: `npm start`

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**

      * In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
      * Install dependencies: `npm install`
      * Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example`.
      * Fill in the required environment variables.
      * Start the development server: `npm run dev`

The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:5173` and the backend on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Environment Variables

You will need to create two `.env` files.

#### `backend/.env`

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
UPSTASH_REDIS_URL=your_upstash_or_local_redis_url
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
PORT=5000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

# 100ms
HMS_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN=your_100ms_management_token
HMS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_100ms_template_id

# Nodemailer (for sending emails)
SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
SMTP_PORT=your_smtp_port
SMTP_USER=your_smtp_user
SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_password
```

#### `frontend/.env`

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
```

-----

## \#\# Deployment

The application is deployed with a decoupled frontend and backend.

  * The **React frontend** is deployed on **Vercel**. The `VITE_API_URL` environment variable is set to the public URL of the Render backend service.
  * The **Node.js backend** is deployed as a **Web Service** on **Render**. To stay on the free tier, the BullMQ worker is initiated within the same server process. All necessary backend environment variables are configured on Render.
